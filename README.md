# Hypixel Discord Chat Bridge

A two-way chat bridge between [Hypixel](https://hypixel.net/) guild chat and a [Discord](https://discord.com/) channel. The application utilizes [discord.js v14](https://github.com/discordjs/discord.js) for communicating with Discord, and [mineflayer](https://github.com/PrismarineJS/mineflayer) for communicating with Hypixel.

> [!WARNING]
> This software allows access to Hypixel using Mineflayer, a non-standard Minecraft client. Using this application carries the risk of your Minecraft account being banned from Hypixel. Therefore, use it at your own discretion. I hold no responsibility for any bans resulting from its usage.

## NodeJS

- Git
- NodeJS >= 16.9
- A Minecraft account

### Setup Guide for NodeJS

To get started, clone down the repository using:

    git clone https://github.com/DuckySoLucky/hypixel-discord-chat-bridge.git

Next go into the `hypixel-discord-chat-bridge` folder and install all the dependencies using NPM.

    npm install

While the dependencies are being installed you can edit the configuration file. The configuration file is called `config.example.json`. It is pretty self explanatory, but if you need help with it, you can check out the [Configuration](#configuration) section. Once you are done editing, save it as another file by the name of `config.json`. Both files are required for the bot to work.

Once edited and the dependencies are installed, you can start the application using:

    node index.js

Using the link provided in the console, you sign into the Minecraft account of your choice.

## Docker

### Requirements

- Git
- Docker >= 20<br>
  _Older versions may also work, but have not been tested._
- A Minecraft account

### Setup

In here we are going to clone the repository, set up the configuration file, volume directory, build the image, and run the container.

- Clone the repository and enter the directory:

      git clone https://github.com/DuckySoLucky/hypixel-discord-chat-bridge.git
      cd hypixel-discord-chat-bridge

- Configure the volume directories in /opt/ as `root`:

      mkdir -p /opt/docker/hypixel-discord-chat-bridge/data/
      mkdir -p /opt/docker/hypixel-discord-chat-bridge/auth-cache/

- Move the following files into the directory using:

      mv config.example.json /opt/docker/hypixel-discord-chat-bridge/config.json
      mv messages.json /opt/docker/hypixel-discord-chat-bridge/messages.json
      mv data/* /opt/docker/hypixel-discord-chat-bridge/data

- Change the ownership of the directory to the user you want to run the container as using:

      chown -R 1000:1000 /opt/docker/hypixel-discord-chat-bridge/

- Edit the configuration file called `config.json` in `/opt/docker/hypixel-discord-chat-bridge/` using the [Configuration](#configuration) section.

- Build the image using:

      docker build . -t hypixel-discord-chat-bridge:latest

- Once the image is built, you can run the container for the first time using:

      docker run -it \
          -v /opt/docker/hypixel-discord-chat-bridge/data:/usr/src/app/data \
          -v /opt/docker/hypixel-discord-chat-bridge/auth-cache:/usr/src/app/auth-cache \
          -v /opt/docker/hypixel-discord-chat-bridge/config.json:/usr/src/app/config.json \
          -v /opt/docker/hypixel-discord-chat-bridge/messages.json:/usr/src/app/messages.json \
          -v /etc/localtime:/etc/localtime:ro \
          --restart unless-stopped \
          --name hypixel-discord-chat-bridge \
          hypixel-discord-chat-bridge:latest

- Using the link provided in the console, sign in to the minecraft account that you want to use.

- Once you are signed in, you can stop the container using:

      Ctrl + C

- Now you can start the container using:

      docker start hypixel-discord-chat-bridge

#### Discord

### Bot

The `bot` options include the `token`, and `serverID` options.

The `token` is the Discord application token, if you don't already have a Discord App, you can [create a new app](https://discordapp.com/developers), then convert the app to a Discord bot, and then get your Discord bot token on the "Bot" page.

The `serverID` is the ID of the server. You can get it by right clicking on server and clicking on Copy ID. You need to enable Developer Mode in Discord to do this, You can enable it by going to `Settings > App > Advanced > Developer Mode`.

### Channels

The `guildChatChannel` is the ID of the text channel where the bot is gonna send messages from Guild Chat.

The `officerChannel` is the ID of the text channel where the bot is gonna send messages from Officer Chat.

The `loggingChannel` is the ID of the text channel where the bot is gonna send guild logs, for example guild kicks, invites, mutes etc.

The `debugMode` is a boolean setting which is an ability to toggle `debugChannel`

The `debugChannel` is the ID of text channel the bot should be linked with for the chat, the bot will send every single minecraft message here, anyone can send and execute commands from this channel and it will be executed in minecraft. This is useful for debugging and testing purposes.

The `allowedBots` is a list of discord bot IDs which are allowed to send messages in the guild chat, their messages will not be blocked.

### Commands

The `checkPerms` is ability to toggle checking permissions for commands, if it's set to `true` the bot will check if user has required role to execute the command.

The `commandRole` is the ID of any role on the server , any user with the role will be able to run all the Discord commands built into the bot, like `/kick` and `/promote`.

The `users` is a list of user IDs which are allowed to run all the Discord commands, this is an alternative to the `commandRole` option.

### Other

The `messageMode` can either be `bot`, `webhook` or `minecraft`. This selects how the messages should be displayed when sent from Minecraft to Discord. If webhook mode is selected the bot requires the `Manage Webhooks` permission in the channel it's running in. The bot always requires the `Send Messages` and `View Channel` permissions in the channel you're using it in.

- Webhook Example

  > ![image](https://github.com/DuckySoLucky/hypixel-discord-chat-bridge/assets/75372052/f53e46d0-fae5-49f5-bdda-c6f6520e1921)

- Bot Example

  > ![image](https://github.com/DuckySoLucky/hypixel-discord-chat-bridge/assets/75372052/7e693926-1408-4f7c-8da8-5f4984fd6ac2)

- Minecraft Example (Default)
  > ![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1072863636596465726/1152304997824999554/Qwack_Bot.png)

> Note - The Discord rate limit for webhooks is 30 requests every 60 seconds, where as for bot and minecraft messages it's 5 messages every 5 seconds. Using webhooks effectively halves the number of messages the bot can send per minute which may cause issues in an active guild.

The messageFormat option is a format for the chat message on the discord side, this can be customized to whatever you want, default format is `{chatType} > {skin} {rank} {username} {guildRank}Â§f: {message}`.

> Possible options for this are `{chatType}`, `{skin}`, `{rank}`, `{username}`, `{guildRank}` and `{message}`. They're self explanation but here's in case you don't know what they are:
>
> - `{chatType}` - Type of chat message, the only possible cases are `Guild` and `Officer`
> - `{skin}` - Skin of the player who sent the message
> - `{rank}` - Hypixel Rank of the player who sent the message
> - `{username}` - Username of the player who sent the message
> - `{guildRank}` - Guild rank of the player who sent the message
> - `{message}` - Message sent by the player

The filterMessage is ability to toggle filtering messages. This should be set to `true` otherwise bot might get banned.

The joinMessage is ability to toggle join and leave message being sent to the discord channel.

The autoLimbo is ability to toggle if the bot is sent to Limbo or stays in public lobbies.

#### Web

The web section contains configuration options for the web server, including the enabled, port, token, and WebSocket functionality.

The enabled option determines whether the web server is enabled. By default, this is set to false.

The port option is the port the web server will listen on. By default, this is set to 1439.

The token option is the token required to access the web server.

The web server also supports WebSocket connections for third-party applications to listen to chat messages. This is achieved by connecting to the `/chat` endpoint. Through this endpoint, clients can receive real-time updates on messages sent in the chat.

Additionally, there's an `/uptime` endpoint available to check the server's uptime. This endpoint can be accessed to verify if the WebSocket server is running and to retrieve information about its uptime.

An example of how to connect to the WebSocket server using JavaScript:

```javascript
// Import WebSocket module
const WebSocket = require("ws");

// Create a new WebSocket connection
const ws = new WebSocket("ws://localhost:1439/message");

// Event listener for when the connection is established
ws.on("open", () => {
  console.log("Connected");
});

// Event listener for when the connection is closed
ws.on("close", () => {
  console.log("Disconnected");
});

// Event listener for incoming messages
ws.on("message", (data) => {
  console.log(`Received: ${data}`);
});

// Send a message to the server
new Promise((resolve) => {
  if (ws.readyState === ws.OPEN) {
    resolve();
  }
}).then(() => {
  // Define the message to be sent
  const send = {
    type: "message",
    data: "/gc Example message",
    token: "WEBSOCKET_TOKEN",
  };

  // Send the message
  ws.send(JSON.stringify(send));
});
```

### Verification

The verification section contains configuration options for the verification system. These options include a full global toggle, verfied role, guild member role, auto updater, custom usernames and ranks.

The `enabled` option determines whether the verification system is enabled. By default, this is set to false.

The `verifiedRole` option determines what role user will receive upon successful verification.

The `guildMemberRole` option determines what role user will receive upon being member of the guild.

The `autoUpdater` option allows you to toggle the auto updating of all verified users. This option is set to `true` by default.

The `autoUpdaterInterval` allows you to change how often the autoUpdater runs. By default this option is set to `24` making the autoUpdater run every 24 hours.

The `levelRoles` option is an array that takes in an object like the following example, this allows roles to be given out if they get some requirement.

```json
{
  "type": "bedwarsStar",
  "requirement": 200,
  "roleId": "987936050649391194"
}
```

For type these are all the options that are supported.
